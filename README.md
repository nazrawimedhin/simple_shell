##SIMPLE SHELL

Built as a project for ALX School.

#Overview

In this project, we implemented a command line interpreter or, as it is more commonly known, a shell.

The shell works like the bash or any other basic shells and takes commands in the following syntax:
`command name {arguments}`.

:When you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished.
